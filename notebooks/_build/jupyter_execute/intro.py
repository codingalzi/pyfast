# ## Why Python?

# ### The scientist's needs

# * Get data (simulation, experiment control),
# * Manipulate and process data,
# * Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality
#   figures, for reports or publications.

# ### Python's strengths

# * **Batteries included** Rich collection of already existing **bricks**
#   of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We
#   don't want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform
#   or a fitting algorithm. Don't reinvent the wheel!
# 
# * **Easy to learn** Most scientists are not payed as programmers, neither
#   have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth
#   a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.
# 
# * **Easy communication** To keep code alive within a lab or a company
#   it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or
#   maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or
#   lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from
#   mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.
# 
# * **Efficient code** Python numerical modules are computationally
#   efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if
#   too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development
#   times and quick execution times.
# 
# * **Universal** Python is a language used for many different problems.
#   Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.

# ### How does Python compare to other solutions?

# **Compiled languages: C, C++, Fortran, ...**
# 
# Pros
# 
#   * Very fast. For heavy computations, it's difficult to outperform these
#     languages.
# 
# Cons
# 
#   * Painful usage: no interactivity during development, mandatory
#     compilation steps, verbose syntax, manual memory management. These
#     are **difficult languages** for non programmers.

# #### Matlab scripting language

# Pros
# 
#   * Very rich collection of libraries with numerous algorithms, for many
#     different domains. Fast execution because these libraries are often written
#     in a compiled language.
# 
#   * Pleasant development environment comprehensive and help, integrated
#     editor, etc.
# 
#   * Commercial support is available.
# 
# Cons
# 
#   * Base language is quite poor and can become restrictive for advanced users.
# 
#   * Not free.

# #### Julia

# Pros
# 
#   * Fast code, yet interactive and simple.
# 
#   * Easily connects to Python or C.
# 
# Cons
# 
#   * Ecosystem limited to numerical computing.
# 
#   * Still young.

# #### Other scripting languages: Scilab, Octave, R, IDL, etc.

# Pros
# 
#   * Open-source, free, or at least cheaper than Matlab.
# 
#   * Some features can be very advanced (statistics in R, etc.)
# 
# Cons
# 
#   * Fewer available algorithms than in Matlab, and the language
#     is not more advanced.
# 
#   * Some software are dedicated to one domain. Ex: Gnuplot to draw
#     curves. These programs are very powerful, but they are restricted to
#     a single type of usage, such as plotting.

# #### Python

# Pros
# 
#   * Very rich scientific computing libraries
# 
#   * Well thought out language, allowing to write very readable and well
#     structured code: we "code what we think".
# 
#   * Many libraries beyond scientific computing (web server,
#     serial port access, etc.)
# 
#   * Free and open-source software, widely spread, with a vibrant community.
# 
#   * A variety of powerful environments to work in, such as
#     [IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
#     [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/),
#     [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/),
#     [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm),
#     [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
# 
# Cons
# 
#   * Not all the algorithms that can be found in more specialized
#     software or toolboxes.

# ## The Scientific Python ecosystem

# Unlike Matlab, or R, Python does not come with a prebundled set
# of modules for scientific computing. Below are the basic building blocks
# that can be combined to obtain a scientific computing environment:

# **Python**, a generic and modern computing language
# 
# * The language: flow control, data types (`string`, `int`),
#   data collections (lists, dictionaries), etc.
# 
# * Modules of the standard library: string processing, file
#   management, simple network protocols.
# 
# * A large number of specialized modules or applications written in
#   Python: web framework, etc. ... and scientific
#   computing.
# 
# * Development tools (automatic testing, documentation generation)

# ## Before starting: Installing a working environment

# Python comes in many flavors, and there are many ways to install it.
# However, we recommend to install a scientificcomputing distribution,
# that comes readily with optimized versions of scientific modules.
# 
# **Under Linux**
# 
# If you have a recent distribution, most of the tools are probably
# packaged, and it is recommended to use your package manager.
# 
# **Other systems**
# 
# There are several fullyfeatured Scientific Python distributions:
# 
# * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
# * [EPD](https://store.enthought.com/downloads)
# * [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io)

# ## The workflow: interactive environments and text editors

# **Interactive work to test and understand algorithms:** In this section, we
# describe a workflow combining interactive work and consolidation.
# 
# Python is a generalpurpose language. As such, there is not one blessed
# environment to work in, and not only one way of using it. Although
# this makes it harder for beginners to find their way, it makes it
# possible for Python to be used for programs, in web servers, or
# embedded devices.

# ### Interactive work

# We recommend an interactive work with the 
# [IPython](http://ipython.org) console, or its offspring, the 
# [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contentquickstart.html). They are handy to explore and understand algorithms.

# **Under the notebook**
# 
# To execute code, press "shift enter"

# Start *ipython*:
# 
# ```
# In [1]: print('Hello world')
# Hello world
# ```

# Getting help by using the **?** operator after an object:

# ```
# In [2]: print?
# Docstring:
# print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
# 
# Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
# Optional keyword arguments:
# file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
# sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
# end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
# flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
# Type:      builtin_function_or_method
# ```

# ### Elaboration of the work in an editor

# As you move forward, it will be important to not only work interactively,
# but also to create and reuse Python files. For this, a powerful code editor
# will get you far. Here are several good easytouse editors:
# 
#   * [Spyder](https://www.spyderide.org/): integrates an IPython
#     console, a debugger, a profiler...
#   * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm): integrates an IPython
#     console, notebooks, a debugger... (freely available,
#     but commercial)
#   * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python):
#     integrates a Python console, notebooks, a debugger, ...
#   * [Atom](https://atom.io)
# 
# Some of these are shipped by the various scientific Python distributions,
# and you can find them in the menus.

# As an exercise, create a file *my_file.py* in a code editor, and add the
# following lines:
# 
# ```
# s = 'Hello world'
# print(s)
# ```

# Now, you can run it in IPython console or a notebook and explore the
# resulting variables:

# ```
# In [1]: %run my_file.py
# Hello world
# 
# In [2]: s
# Out[2]: 'Hello world'
# 
# In [3]: %whos
# Variable   Type    Data/Info
# ----------------------------
# s          str     Hello world
# ```

# ```{seealso}
# 
# **From a script to functions**
# 
# While it is tempting to work only with scripts, that is a file full
# of instructions following each other, do plan to progressively evolve
# the script to a set of functions:
# 
# * A script is not reusable, functions are.
# 
# * Thinking in terms of functions helps breaking the problem in small
#   blocks.
# ```

# ### IPython and Jupyter Tips and Tricks

# The user manuals contain a wealth of information. Here we give a quick
# introduction to four useful features: *history*, *tab completion*, *magic
# functions*, and *aliases*.

# **Command history** Like a UNIX shell, the IPython console supports
# command history. Type *up* and *down* to navigate previously typed
# commands:

# ```
# In [1]: x = 10
# 
# In [2]: <UP>
# 
# In [2]: x = 10
# ```

# **Tab completion** Tab completion, is a convenient way to explore the
# structure of any object you’re dealing with. Simply type object_name.<TAB> to
# view the object’s attributes. Besides Python objects and keywords, tab
# completion also works on file and directory names.*

# ```
# In [1]: x = 10
# 
# In [2]: x.<TAB>
# x.bit_length   x.denominator  x.imag         x.real
# x.conjugate    x.from_bytes   x.numerator    x.to_bytes
# ```

# **Magic functions**
# The console and the notebooks support socalled *magic* functions by prefixing a command with the
# `%` character. For example, the `run` and `whos` functions from the
# previous section are magic functions. Note that, the setting `automagic`,
# which is enabled by default, allows you to omit the preceding `%` sign. Thus,
# you can just type the magic function and it will work.
# 
# Other useful magic functions are:
# 
# * `%cd` to change the current directory.
# 
#     ```
#     In [1]: cd /tmp
#     /tmp
#     ```
# 
# * `%cpaste` allows you to paste code, especially code from websites which has
#   been prefixed with the standard Python prompt (e.g. `>>>`) or with an ipython
#   prompt, (e.g. `in [3]`):
# 
#     ```
#     In [2]: %cpaste
#     Pasting code; enter '' alone on the line to stop or use CtrlD.
#     :>>> for i in range(3):
#     :...     print(i)
#     :--
#     0
#     1
#     2
#     ```
#     
# * `%timeit` allows you to time the execution of short snippets using the
#   `timeit` module from the standard library:
# 
#     ```
#     In [3]: %timeit x = 10
#     10000000 loops, best of 3: 39 ns per loop
#     ```
#     
#     **참고**: `<optimizing_code_chapter>`
# 
# * `%debug` allows you to enter postmortem debugging. That is to say, if the
#   code you try to execute, raises an exception, using `%debug` will enter the
#   debugger at the point where the exception was thrown.
# 
#     ```
#     In [4]: x === 10
#     File "<ipythoninput612fd421b5f28>", line 1
#         x === 10
#         ^
#     SyntaxError: invalid syntax
# 
#     In [5]: %debug
#     > /.../IPython/core/compilerop.py (87)ast_parse()
#          86         and are passed to the builtin compile function."""
#     ---> 87         return compile(source, filename, symbol, self.flags  PyCF_ONLY_AST, 1)
#          88
# 
#     ipdb>locals()
#     {'source': u'x === 10\n', 'symbol': 'exec', 'self':
#     <IPython.core.compilerop.CachingCompiler instance at 0x2ad8ef0>,
#     'filename': '<ipythoninput612fd421b5f28>'}
#     ```
# 
#     **참고**: `<debugging_chapter>`

# **Aliases**
# Furthermore IPython ships with various *aliases* which emulate common UNIX
# command line tools such as `ls` to list files, `cp` to copy files and `rm` to
# remove files (a full list of aliases is shown when typing `alias`).

# **Getting help**
# 
# * The builtin cheatsheet is accessible via the `%quickref` magic
#     function.
# 
# * A list of all available magic functions is shown when typing `%magic`.
